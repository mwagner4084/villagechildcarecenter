                            We know it can be stressful to find care for your children
                            before and after school care. We offer care with Kalamazoo
                            bus transportation. While your children are with us during
                            this time, they will have the opportunity to relax, do homework,
                            play outside, and play in our S.T.E.A.M room classroom.
