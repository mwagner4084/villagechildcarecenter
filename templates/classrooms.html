                        The Village faculty is eager to share in the process of potty training. 
                        Our official potty-training age is 24-35 months. At this age our classroom 
                        faculty works diligently with the children to promote using the toilet. 
                        We do realize that some children begin training at younger ages. In these 
                        cases, our faculty will work with your child on a more individual basis to 
                        reinforce procedures that you are using at home. 
                        <br>
                        Your child may be ready for potty training if: 
                        <ul class="fs-5">
                            <li>
                                They have a dry diaper for two hours or more. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They have a dry diaper after naptime. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They tell you when their diaper needs to be changed. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They tell you when they are urinating or making a bowel movement in their diaper. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They show an interest or curiosity in using the toilet. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="fs-5">
                        As your child is beginning to potty train, we suggest heavy cotton training pants 
                        which may be more effective than pull-ups. Cotton pants may leave your child feeling 
                        a bit uncomfortable so that they will quickly learn to relieve themselves using the 
                        toilet. Pull-ups are most effective AFTER the child has shown that they are dry most 
                        of the time or at bedtime. Please remind your child to go to the potty at home. When 
                        he or she is successful, use positive reinforcement. It is not recommended that your 
                        child be allowed to wear underpants over diapers or pull-ups. This defeats the purpose 
                        of them and removes the incentive for your child to wear underwear. Lastly, it is 
                        important to be consistent in whichever method you choose to use.

                        problem-solving methods from grade to grade, so math concepts stay with them, year after year.

                        children's literacy skills and music to support learning. These resources are a first step in
