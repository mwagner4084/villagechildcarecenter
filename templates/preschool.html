                            Our Preschool Program is an optional program as well as open to the public.
                            In our preschool program our teachers will introduce interscope curriculum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Interscope curriculum</strong> offers additional resources designed to support daily learning. Includes
                            strategies to individualize learning throughout the daily routine and
                            activities for building children's literacy skills and music to support
                            learning. These resources are a first step in creating and engaging the rich
                            learning environment that encourages young children to learn through exploration.
                            Combined with diverse, open-ended materials that reflect children's home, language,
                            and culture to provide an optimal learning environment that truly aligns with active
                            learning.

                        <p>
